“The origin of logical thinking must be sought among the fifth sub-race, the Orinignal Semites.”

While the people of the fourth sub-race rushed wildly  towards the satisfaction of their desires, those of the fifth began the satisfaction of their desires.
Those of the fifth began to listen to an inner voice
This inner voice restrains the desires, although it cannot destroy the claims of the selfish personality

Thus the fifth sub-race transferred the impulses for action to within the human being.

The people of the sixth sub-race, the Akkadians developed the faculty for thought even further than the fifth.
They employed this faculty in a more comprehensive sense than the former

“In the sixth, this order had to be brought about by thought-out laws. Thus it is in this sixth sub-race that one must look for the origin of the regulation of justice and law.”
